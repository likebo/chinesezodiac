<p class="has-ast-global-color-4-background-color has-background">The year 2025, under the sign of the Wood Snake (乙巳), brings &#8220;刑&#8221; (conflict) between Snake (巳) and Ox (丑). This indicates a year of fluctuating fortunes, requiring caution and adaptability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Career</h2>



<p>The Fire element of Snake supports the Earth element of Ox, bringing potential career growth. However, due to the conflict between the signs, obstacles and competition may arise in the workplace. Stay patient and resilient; avoid impulsive decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wealth</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Relationships</h2>



<p>The conflict between Snake and Ox signals difficulties in relationships. Singles may find it hard to form new connections, while married individuals might experience disagreements or conflicts. Open communication and mutual understanding are essential to navigate these challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Health</h2>



<p>With the strong Fire influence, health issues may emerge. Pay attention to problems related to the digestive system or skin allergies. Maintain good dietary habits and ensure a regular sleep schedule to stay healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warnings</h2>



<p>Trouble from Others: The Fire element of Snake (巳) supports the Earth element of Ox (丑), which can amplify the influence of ill-willed individuals. Be cautious of gossip and avoid unnecessary conflicts.</p>



<p>Emotional Instability: The conflict between Snake and Ox may lead to emotional fluctuations. Stay calm and avoid impulsive behavior.<br>Accidents and Mishaps: The restraining effect of Fire on Earth increases the risk of accidents. Prioritize safety, especially while traveling, and follow traffic rules diligently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Suggestions</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Face challenges proactively and turn obstacles into opportunities for growth.</li>

<li>Resolve conflicts through effective communication to strengthen relationships.</li>
